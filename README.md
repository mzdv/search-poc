#Example application that saves last five queries that were searched

##Made with love using React and Flux

This is a PoC, so everything is minimal - almost zero ES6, small build system and everything is by the book.

##Usage

First `npm install` and then `npm start`

Open the `index.html` in the browser of your choice.

Next, start using it. If you want to test the 'Additional results feature', try giving it one of the following strings:

- apple
- banana
- kiwi
- orange
- grapefruit

And then clicking on the query when it becomes displayed.


##Production usage

In case you want to use this in production, run `npm build` and then proceed to deployment.
